# Clavain Philosophy

## Purpose
Self-improving agent rig — codifies product and engineering discipline into composable workflows from brainstorm to ship. Compounds knowledge, generates domain agents, and monitors its own docs. Orchestrates Claude, Codex, and GPT-5.2 Pro through 15 skills, 4 agents, 52 commands, 12 hooks. Companions: interphase, interline, interflux, interpath, interwatch, interslack, interform, intercraft, interdev, interpeer, intertest.

## North Star
Treat Clavain as the orchestration brain: disciplined workflow routing, robust review gates, and dependable inter-module handoffs before expanding automation surface area.

## Working Priorities
- Workflow discipline
- Gate reliability
- Inter-module orchestration

## Brainstorming Doctrine
1. Start from outcomes and failure modes, not implementation details.
2. Generate at least three options: conservative, balanced, and aggressive.
3. Explicitly call out assumptions, unknowns, and dependency risk across modules.
4. Prefer ideas that improve clarity, reversibility, and operational visibility.

## Planning Doctrine
1. Convert selected direction into small, testable, reversible slices.
2. Define acceptance criteria, verification steps, and rollback path for each slice.
3. Sequence dependencies explicitly and keep integration contracts narrow.
4. Reserve optimization work until correctness and reliability are proven.

## Decision Filters
- Does this reduce ambiguity for future sessions?
- Does this improve reliability without inflating cognitive load?
- Is the change observable, measurable, and easy to verify?
- Can we revert safely if assumptions fail?
