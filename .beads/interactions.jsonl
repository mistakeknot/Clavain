None of these exist in Cursor.\n\nA proof-of-concept adapter was built and tested in this session (2026-02-09). Two skill files at ~/.cursor/skills-cursor/ successfully translated Clavain agent dispatch to Cursor's Task(generalPurpose) model. The architecture-strategist agent ran in codebase-aware mode and produced a full architectural review of flux-drive P0 beads.\n\n## What the adapter needs\n\n**1. Routing skill** (`adapters/cursor/clavain/SKILL.md`)\n- CLAVAIN_ROOT path resolution (auto-detect from plugin cache or local checkout)\n- 3-layer routing table (stage/domain/language) from using-clavain\n- Agent dispatch translation: clavain:review:* → Task(generalPurpose) + agent .md content as system prompt\n- Skill access pattern: Read tool instead of Skill tool\n- Supersedes notice for older superpowers/compound-engineering plugins\n- Known limitations (no Codex dispatch, no hooks, no Oracle/cross-AI)\n\n**2. Flux-drive wrapper** (`adapters/cursor/clavain-flux-drive/SKILL.md`)\n- Phase-by-phase overrides for Cursor environment\n- Skip Codex mode detection (always Task dispatch)\n- Skip Phase 4 cross-AI (Oracle not available)\n- Agent roster quick-reference with relative file paths\n- Points to source SKILL.md for orchestration logic\n\n**3. Install script** (`adapters/cursor/install.sh`)\n- Copies or symlinks adapter skills into ~/.cursor/skills-cursor/\n- Detects CLAVAIN_ROOT (local checkout vs plugin cache)\n- Idempotent (safe to re-run)\n\n**4. Optional: additional skill wrappers** for high-value skills\n- brainstorming, writing-plans, systematic-debugging, requesting-code-review\n- Thin wrappers that read from source, not full copies\n\n## Translation table\n\n| Claude Code | Cursor | Adapter handles |\n|---|---|---|\n| Skill tool invocation | Read tool on SKILL.md | Routing skill |\n| subagent_type: clavain:review:* | Task(generalPurpose) + .md content | Routing skill |\n| /clavain:command slash commands | Natural language triggers | Skill descriptions |\n| SessionStart hook (context injection) | Always-applied skill | Routing skill |\n| PreToolUse hook (autopilot) | Not mappable | Documented as limitation |\n| SessionEnd hook (sync) | Not mappable | Documented as limitation |\n| MCP servers | Cursor MCP config | User configures separately |\n\n## What was validated\n\n- Agent dispatch via generalPurpose works — agents enter codebase-aware mode and produce specialized reviews\n- Skill descriptions with broad trigger phrases enable auto-discovery in Cursor\n- Phase files (launch.md, synthesize.md) can be read on demand with no modification\n- The adapter is pure markdown — no compiled code, no dependencies\n\n## Open questions\n\n- Should the adapter live in adapters/cursor/ or be a separate repo?\n- Should it auto-detect whether it's running in Claude Code vs Cursor and adjust behavior?\n- How to handle MCP server configuration (context7, qmd, agent-mail)?\n- Should there be a Cursor .mdc rule file in addition to the skills?","created_at":"2026-02-09T23:32:16Z"}]}
