The flux-drive architecture evaluation (docs/research or brain artifact) recommends the opposite: make YAML frontmatter the native format in all review agent .md files, eliminating the 50-line Output Format Override block from the prompt template. Both solve the same problem (the override conflict between agent native format and flux-drive format), but in different directions. Clavain-27u centralizes structured output at the orchestrator. Native YAML pushes it to agents. Decision needed: which approach better suits the overall system?
