# shellcheck: sourced library — no set -euo pipefail (would alter caller's error policy)
# Shared signal detection library for Clavain Stop hooks.
#
# Usage:
#   source hooks/lib-signals.sh
#   detect_signals "$TRANSCRIPT_TEXT"
#   echo "Signals: $CLAVAIN_SIGNALS (weight: $CLAVAIN_SIGNAL_WEIGHT)"
#
# After calling detect_signals(), two variables are set:
#   CLAVAIN_SIGNALS       — comma-separated list of detected signal names
#   CLAVAIN_SIGNAL_WEIGHT — integer total weight of all detected signals
#
# Signal definitions:
#   commit          (weight 1) — git commit in transcript
#   resolution      (weight 2) — debugging resolution phrases
#   investigation   (weight 2) — root cause / investigation language
#   bead-closed     (weight 1) — bd close in transcript
#   recovery        (weight 2) — test/build failure followed by pass
#   version-bump    (weight 2) — bump-version.sh or interpub:release
#
# Removed: insight (weight 1) — ★ Insight block marker. This is a style artifact
# from explanatory output mode, always present, and inflated signal weight.

# Guard against re-parsing function definitions (performance optimization).
# Note: detect_signals() resets output vars on each call — no persistent state.
