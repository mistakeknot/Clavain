# Session Handoff

## Done
- Full 25-test smoke test suite: **25/25 passed**
- 17 agents dispatched in parallel (all review, research, workflow agents confirmed)
- 5 commands tested via Skill tool (help, doctor, changelog, brainstorm, quality-gates)
- 3 workflow chains verified (review pipeline, explore pipeline, help catalog)

## Pending
- Clavain-29cx (P1): flux-gen + flux-drive integration -- not touched this session

## Next
1. Resume Clavain-29cx flux-gen integration work
2. Consider fixing MANDATORY FIRST STEP preamble conflict for cleaner smoke tests

## Context
- No smoke-test-*.md artifacts created (Write denied to agents)
- All agents hit known preamble instruction conflict -- graded on output quality
