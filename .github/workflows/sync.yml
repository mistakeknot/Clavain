            You are running an automated upstream sync for the Clavain plugin repository.

            ## Context

            Clavain aggregates skills, agents, and commands from 4 upstream repos. The file
            `upstreams.json` tracks the last-synced commit for each upstream and maps upstream
            file paths to local Clavain file paths.

            DRY_RUN mode: ${{ inputs.dry_run }}

            ## Your Task

            For each upstream defined in `upstreams.json`:

            ### 1. Clone and diff
            - Clone the upstream repo to `/tmp/upstream/<name>` (shallow is fine)
            - Get the current HEAD commit hash
            - Compare HEAD against `lastSyncedCommit` from upstreams.json
            - If `basePath` is set (e.g. "plugins/compound-engineering"), only look at files under that prefix
            - Run: `git diff --name-status <lastSyncedCommit> HEAD -- <basePath or .>`
            - If the lastSyncedCommit isn't reachable (shallow clone), deepen with `git fetch --deepen=500` then retry, or `git fetch --unshallow` as last resort

            ### 2. Filter to mapped files
            - For each changed file, strip the `basePath` prefix, then check if it exists in the `fileMap`
            - Glob patterns like `references/*` mean: any file in that directory should map to the same-named file in the local path
            - Skip files not in the fileMap (they're upstream-only, not relevant to Clavain)

            ### 3. Merge changes
            For each mapped file that changed:

            **If the file is NEW upstream and doesn't exist locally:** copy it in.

            **If the file is MODIFIED and exists locally:** This is the critical step.
            - Read the local file content
            - Get the upstream diff for that file
            - Read the upstream file's full new content
            - Delegate the merge to Codex by running:
              ```
              codex exec -p "You are merging upstream changes into a local file. RULES: 1) Preserve ALL local YAML frontmatter (the --- block) exactly as-is. 2) Preserve local section headers and custom sections. 3) Apply upstream content changes (new paragraphs, updated code blocks, new sections). 4) Preserve any Clavain-specific content not in upstream. 5) Replace 'superpowers' references with 'clavain' where the local file uses 'clavain'. Output ONLY the merged file, no code fences, no explanation. LOCAL FILE: $(cat <local-path>) UPSTREAM DIFF: $(git diff ...) UPSTREAM FULL: $(cat <upstream-path>)" --model o3 --sandbox workspace-write
              ```
            - Validate the result: must not be empty, must preserve frontmatter if original had it
            - If validation fails, fall back to keeping the local file unchanged and log a warning

            **If the file was DELETED upstream:** skip it, log for manual review.

            **If DRY_RUN is "true":** only report what would change, don't write any files.

            ### 4. Update state
            - After processing all upstreams, update `lastSyncedCommit` in upstreams.json to each upstream's current HEAD
            - Do NOT update the commit hash for any upstream that had errors

            ### 5. Report
            - Print a clear summary: per-upstream, how many files changed, how many merged, how many skipped/errored
            - If any files were updated, commit them with message:
              "sync: apply upstream changes from parent repos"

            ## Important Notes
            - The `fileMap` has renamed files: e.g. upstream `using-superpowers/SKILL.md` maps to local `using-clavain/SKILL.md`
            - compound-engineering has `basePath: "plugins/compound-engineering"` — strip this prefix from upstream paths before looking up in fileMap
            - Some fileMap values use glob patterns like `references/*` — expand these against the actual upstream directory listing
            - Always use `codex exec` for the actual file merge (not just Claude) — this gives us cross-model verification
            - If `codex` is not available in PATH, fall back to doing the merge yourself directly

            ## Upstream Sync

            Automated sync from upstream parent repositories using Claude Code + Codex.

            **Upstreams checked:**
            - [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)
            - [superpowers-lab](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-lab)
            - [superpowers-dev](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-developing-for-claude-code)
            - [compound-engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin)

            Review the file changes carefully — merges were performed by AI and may need manual adjustment.
