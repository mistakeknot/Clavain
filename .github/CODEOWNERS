# Clavain CODEOWNERS — require review for security-sensitive paths
#
# The upstream sync workflow auto-merges external content into skill files
# that become system prompts. These rules ensure human review for:
# 1. Hook scripts (execute as code)
# 2. The bootstrap routing skill (injected into every session)
# 3. Plugin manifest (controls MCP server config)
# 4. Sync configuration (controls what gets merged)
# 5. GitHub workflows (CI/CD pipeline)

# Hook scripts and registration — execute as code on every session

# Bootstrap routing skill — injected into every session via SessionStart hook
/skills/using-clavain/           @mistakeknot

# Plugin manifest — controls MCP servers, version, metadata

# Sync configuration — controls what upstream content gets merged
