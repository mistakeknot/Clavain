# Sprint Status

Run a comprehensive scan of the current project's sprint workflow state using the scanner library. This is the on-demand deep version of the lightweight sprint check that runs at session start.

## How to Run

Source the scanner library and run the full scan via Bash:

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/sprint-scan.sh" && sprint_full_scan
```

Present the output directly — it's already formatted as markdown sections.

## Sections Explained

The full scan reports on 7 areas:

### 1. Session Continuity
Checks for `HANDOFF.md` — generated by the session-handoff hook when a session ends with incomplete work. If present, read it before starting new work.

### 2. Workflow Pipeline
Counts artifacts at each stage:
- **Brainstorms** — `docs/brainstorms/*-brainstorm.md`
- **PRDs** — `docs/prds/*.md`
- **Plans** — `docs/plans/*.md`

A healthy pipeline has brainstorms flowing into PRDs and plans. Brainstorms without plans suggest work that was explored but never executed.

### 3. Plan Progress
For each plan with checklist items (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), shows completion percentage. Plans below 50% that are older than a day may be stalled.

### 4. Orphaned Brainstorms
Brainstorms whose topic slug doesn't appear in any plan or PRD filename. These represent explored ideas that were never formalized.

### 5. Beads Health
If beads is available (`bd` installed and `.beads/` exists):
- Overall stats (`bd stats`)
- Stale bead count (in-progress with no recent activity)

### 6. Skipped Phases
Analyzes the last 20 git commits for ones that don't reference any plan, bead, PR, or review. These may represent work that skipped the brainstorm→plan→execute→review pipeline. Excludes chore/docs/ci commits.

### 7. Recommendations
1-3 prioritized next actions based on the scan results. When everything is clean, reports "Ready to work."

## After the Scan

Based on the recommendations:
- **HANDOFF.md found** → Read it with the Read tool, then resume that work
- **Orphaned brainstorms** → Ask the user which to convert with `/write-plan` or close
- **Strategy gap** → Suggest `/strategy` to bridge brainstorms to plans
- **Stale beads** → List them and ask which to close or update
- **Low plan completion** → Suggest `/work <plan>` to make progress

If everything is clean, confirm the project is in good shape and ask what the user wants to work on.
