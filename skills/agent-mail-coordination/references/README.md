# MCP Agent Mail Upstream Mirror

This directory is a mirror target for selected files from
`Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail` (README, Codex integration assets, ADRs,
and operations docs).

Mappings are defined in `upstreams.json` and applied by `.github/workflows/sync.yml`.
Treat mirrored files as upstream-owned; local Clavain-specific workflow guidance
belongs in `skills/agent-mail-coordination/SKILL.md`.
