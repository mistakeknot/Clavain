# Oracle Upstream Mirror

This directory mirrors selected docs from `steipete/oracle` that are relevant
to Clavain's cross-AI review skill (`interpeer` with quick/deep/council/mine modes).

Mappings are defined in `upstreams.json` and applied by `.github/workflows/sync.yml`.
Keep Clavain-specific instructions in `skills/interpeer/SKILL.md` and
`skills/interpeer/references/oracle-reference.md`.
