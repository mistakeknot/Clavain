# Brainstorming (compact)

Collaborative dialogue: idea → questions → approaches → design → documentation.

## Process

1. **Understand:** Check project state (files, docs, commits). Ask questions one at a time. Prefer multiple choice. Focus on purpose, constraints, success criteria.
2. **Explore:** Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs. Lead with recommendation.
3. **Present design:** Break into 200-300 word sections. Check after each: "Does this look right so far?"
4. **Document:** Write to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`. Commit.
5. **Handoff:** Ask "Ready for implementation?" → use `clavain:writing-plans`.

## Principles

- One question per message
- YAGNI ruthlessly
- Incremental validation
- Go back and clarify when needed
