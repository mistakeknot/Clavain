# Oracle Upstream Mirror

This directory mirrors selected docs from `steipete/oracle` that are relevant
to Clavain's Oracle-powered skills (`winterpeer`, `prompterpeer`, `splinterpeer`,
and `interpeer` integrations).

Mappings are defined in `upstreams.json` and applied by `.github/workflows/sync.yml`.
Keep Clavain-specific instructions in `skills/winterpeer/SKILL.md` and
`skills/winterpeer/references/oracle-reference.md`.
